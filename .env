Weak Points / Limitations of the Current AI Writing Assistant Plugin
API Dependency & Cost

Relies fully on the Cohere API, so if their service is down or changes pricing drastically, it affects your plugin functionality and costs.

No offline or fallback option.

Basic License System

The license key system is very simple (just checks for a hardcoded key). No server-side license validation, no expiration, no upgrade flow, no refunds, etc.

Easily bypassed if someone inspects code.

Limited Language Support

Only supports 4 languages currently. Adding more or user-customizable language options could be beneficial.

User Interface

Admin UI is basic and functional but could use UX improvements, better feedback, and more polished styling.

No frontend integration yet (e.g., block editor, frontend widget).

Error Handling

Basic error feedback in AJAX but no detailed diagnostics or logging for failures.

If API returns unexpected responses, it might break silently or confuse users.

No Rate Limiting or Quotas

Plugin does not limit user requests or handle API rate limits gracefully. Could cause unexpected failures or high costs.

Security Considerations

No nonce or capability checks beyond basics for AJAX endpoints (but you do have nonce).

No sanitization on some inputs if extended in the future.

WooCommerce Product Support

Only supports simple products; no support for variable products or advanced WooCommerce features.

No Analytics or Usage Reporting

No tracking of how many generations, saves, or usage data, which can be important for admins.

No Content Moderation or Filtering

Generated content might not be moderated for appropriateness, which can be risky for public sites.

No Export/Import or Bulk Actions

No way to bulk-generate or manage generated content, which limits scale.
